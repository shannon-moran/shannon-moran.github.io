Rough draft of personal website.

Next steps, template:
- [ ] Redirect index.html to show "about" page
- [ ] Update coloring from whatever is currently borrowed from jakevdp
- [ ] Find way to add social links back in to about page

Next steps, content:
- [x] Make publications list
- [x] Upload all pdfs
- [x] Update CV and upload
- [x] Add some way to contact me

To generate site from directory in the command line:
``` pelican content
cd output; pythom -m pelican.server
```

The site is then available at `localhost:8000`.

# Hi, I'm Shannon Moran

I'm a PhD candidate in Chemical Engineering at the University of Michigan working under [Sharon Glotzer](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/home/). I research colloidal self-assembly using computational methods. Before coming back for my PhD, I did my undergrad at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) and worked in management consulting at [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/).

You can find me on:
