Rough draft of personal website.

Next steps, template:
- [ ] Redirect index.html to show "about" page
- [ ] Update coloring from whatever is currently borrowed from jakevdp
- [ ] Find way to add social links back in to about page

Next steps, content:
- [x] Make publications list
- [x] Upload all pdfs
- [x] Update CV and upload
- [x] Add some way to contact me

To generate site from directory in the command line:
``` pelican content
cd output; pythom -m pelican.server
```

The site is then available at `localhost:8000`.
