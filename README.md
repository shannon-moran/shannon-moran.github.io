# Hi, I'm Shannon Moran

I'm a PhD candidate in Chemical Engineering at the University of Michigan working under [Sharon Glotzer](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/home/). I research colloidal self-assembly using computational methods. Before coming back for my PhD, I did my undergrad at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) and worked in management consulting at [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/).
