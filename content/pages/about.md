slug: about

I'm a PhD candidate in Chemical Engineering working with [Professor Sharon Glotzer](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/home/) at the University of Michigan.

I'm supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), [Point Scholar Fellowship](https://pointfoundation.org/), and the [ACM/SIGHPC Intel Computational & Data Science Fellowship](http://www.sighpc.org/fellowships).

I use computational methods to study how materials self-assemble.

Previously, I was a Consultant at the [Boston Consulting Group](https://www.bcg.com/en-us/default.aspx) and did my B.S. in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Writing from [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/).

[Email](mailto:moranse@umich.edu) is the best way of contacting me.
