slug: about

I'm a PhD candidate in Chemical Engineering working with [Professor Sharon Glotzer](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/home/) at the University of Michigan. I'm an [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), [Point Scholar](https://pointfoundation.org/), and recipient of an [ACM/SIGHPC Intel Computational & Data Science Fellowship](http://www.sighpc.org/fellowships). I'm lucky that this support has allowed me intellectual freedom in grad school most PhD students don't get. Currently, I use computational methods to study how materials self-assemble in non-equilibrium conditions.

Previously, I was a Consultant at the [Boston Consulting Group](https://www.bcg.com/en-us/default.aspx) and did my B.S. in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Writing from [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/).
