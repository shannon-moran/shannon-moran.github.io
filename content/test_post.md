Summary: Testing out Pelican markdown posts

Testing out a new implementation with Pelican, so I can add jupyter notebooks here in the future.

Adding a snippet of python code below.

```python
if post_type=='new':
  print('Hello world!')
else: raise ValueError
```

And let's see how formulas work, while we're at it.
$$ \text{S} = -k_b \ln{\Omega}$$
